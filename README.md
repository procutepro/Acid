# Acid the only thing i am making which i am going to use

## Intro

   ### Intro

   Ok now it is kinda ok.

   In simple words acid is a wrapper around some tools like pygame and opengl what about math that is my own code kinda.

   How to use it lets see.
    
   to import you just:

      import acid.pythontwo.window.window as WW(or whatever you like)

   now that example was for 2D but what about 3D- (Shut up no body cares we will add docs for 3D later because i am lazy AF bois)

   now to start it we just say to it:

      window = WW.window((800, 600))

      window.init()

   ### Game loop

   but if you run it, it will show you a screen for a milli-second,
   so to solve that you make a while loop and put 2 things in it 3 is you wanna fill the screen with something else color (wtf was that grammar my guy)

   example code again bois:

    while window.brorunning:
        window.loop()
        window.mupdate()
    
   ### Creating Shapes

   i will do this part later
